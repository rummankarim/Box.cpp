# Box.cpp

# Motivation
The goal of this program is to have the user input a height and a width. Afterwards the program will print out the requested size using asteriks. 

## How to run this program on a Mac
To run this program on a mac you must have it saved as Box.cpp (once again this is just a sguggestion if you have a better name go for it). Make sure it is saved on your desktop so it will be easier to access. Once that is done open up your terminal and change your directory to the desktop. This can be done by typing in cd Desktop. Once the directory is in the desktop to access the program you will have to type in g++ Box.cpp. The g++ is necessary because it is the c++ compiler. Once your enter that this line should appear "Rummans-MacBook-Air:Desktop Rumman$" In my case my name appears because it's my computer however when you are running it your own name should appear. If this line appears it means your code has no mistakes and is ready to be executed by the compiler. In order to execute you must type in ./a.out. This tells the operating system to run the program. In this case when you enter the first thing that should pop up is "Enter a width:"

## How to run this program on a Windows

## Extra notes
If you notice I also uploaded a second program called Box1.cpp. The difference between this program and the orginal box.cpp is that in the Box1.cpp I added an extra if else statement. The purpose of this statement is to restrict the user's input. For example if the height or width is over 100 the program will ask the user to renter valid inputs. This is not necessary but if you wanted to make it with restrictions this is one way to do it. However there are other ways to implement this and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
